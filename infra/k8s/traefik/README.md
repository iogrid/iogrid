# Traefik Phase 0 shim

The iogrid.org public surface is fronted by the OpenOva mothership's
Traefik instance (in `kube-system`) — see `docs/PHASE0-UNBLOCK.md`. The
canonical routing intent lives in `infra/k8s/gateways/` (Cilium Gateway
+ HTTPRoute), but until the mothership migrates to Cilium Gateway we
translate that intent into Traefik `IngressRoute` objects here.

This directory is **applied directly to the iogrid namespace** of the
mothership cluster (not via Flux) so the manifests can be cherry-picked
quickly without a reconcile loop. A follow-up PR wires them into the
Flux Kustomization once the dispatch chain is stable.

## What's in here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `serverstransport-long-lived.yaml` | Disables Traefik→backend idle-conn / read / write timeouts so Connect-RPC bidi streams (`WorkloadDispatchService.Dispatch`) can stay open for the lifetime of a paired daemon (minutes-to-hours). Also enables h2 PING keepalive on the Traefik→backend leg. #271 |
| `ingressroute-workloads.yaml` | `api.iogrid.org/iogrid.workloads.v1*` → `workloads-svc:8080` (h2c). References the long-lived `ServersTransport` and sets `responseForwarding.flushInterval: 100ms` so server-sent frames (CoordinatorHello, Assignment, TunnelData) reach the daemon within ~100ms instead of being buffered to Traefik's default 1s mark. |
| `ingressroutetcp-proxy-passthrough.yaml` | `proxy.iogrid.org:443` → `proxy-gateway:443` (TLS passthrough, NOT termination). proxy-gateway speaks SOCKS5-over-TLS; Traefik must NOT terminate TLS at the edge or the SOCKS5 framing gets parsed as HTTP and the customer connection hangs. The Cilium Gateway form of the same intent already lives in `infra/k8s/gateways/tlsroute-proxy.yaml`; this IngressRouteTCP is the live Traefik materialisation until the mothership cuts over. #350 |
| `ingressroute-admin.yaml` | `admin.iogrid.org` → `admin:3000` (HTTPS terminate). Phase-0 routing for the standalone admin Next.js app split out of `web/` in #361. Vanilla HTTP/1.1 — no h2c / SSE / bidi stream concerns; auth is in-app via `IOGRID_ADMIN_EMAILS`. mTLS hardening deferred to a follow-up. #361 |

## Why these exist (issue #271)

After #260 (Service `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c`) and #261 (server
`h2c.NewHandler`) shipped, the daemon's TLS handshake to the coordinator
succeeded but the bidi `Dispatch` stream still died within ~5-10 seconds
before the `DaemonHello` frame reached `workloads-svc`. The investigation
in #271 traced this to Traefik's default `ServersTransport` settings:

* `forwardingTimeouts.idleConnTimeout: 90s` — pool-level idle close
* `forwardingTimeouts.readIdleTimeout: 0s` — but Go's HTTP/2 transport
  may still h2-PING and reset on missed pongs
* No explicit `responseForwarding.flushInterval` — defaults to 1s for
  non-SSE responses, which holds the `CoordinatorHello` frame in the
  proxy's write buffer past the daemon's 10s ack timeout

The `ServersTransport` here disables those timeouts and the `Middleware`
forces an immediate flush on every server-sent frame. With both applied
the daemon stays connected for the lifetime of `iogridd` and
`DaemonHello` is registered in the dispatcher on the first attempt.

## Apply

```
kubectl -n iogrid apply -f infra/k8s/traefik/
```

The objects are idempotent; re-applying is safe.
